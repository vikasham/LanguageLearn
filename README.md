# LanguageLearn

HackSC project

LanguageLearn is an app meant to help people learn new languages by engaging in dynamic conversations. Simply choose what language you want to speak, and what language you want the chatbot to respond in, and watch (or, rather, hear) your conversation flow! Built with various Google APIs and a chat API.

To run on your local machine: 
1. clone repo
2. npm install for dependencies
